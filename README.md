# Wealth Inequality Simulator/ Visualization

Utilized a real-time financial data API to visualize the wealth gap between the ultra-rich and the average citizen.
This application was designed to be informative and incite conversation on economic and financial inequality.



The application was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS within a React framework. [Mantine](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine) was chosen as the component library due to the wide variety of styles and themes, along with the great support and documentation. Toast-notifications to handle unsuitable user-input were generated by [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/).

### Step 1: Choosing your billionaire:
As seen below, you first must choose your billionaire of interest. More information surrounding the billionaire and his/her personal life is shown in the space below. The financial data API will keep the list and information up-to-date.

### Step 2: Purchase your items:
Navigate downward to the item categories and choose which items you want to purchase. Use the "buy" and "sell" buttons on each item card to purchase each item. Additionally, you may type in the value of the items you want to purchase. The green bar will stick to the top of the screen as you navigate throughout the site, and will automatically update as you make purchases.

### Step 3: Being aware of toast notifications/ error handling:
The list of items is not comprehensive-- I tried to include as many items as I could that ranged from "normal, everyday" things all the way to ultra-expensive and one-of-a-kind purchases. That being said, if you happened to try to buy 2 of a "single-existence" item (such as the Salvator Mundi), an error message will pop up on the screen indicating that you may only purchase 1 of these items. Similarily, you are unable to purchase more than 32 NFL teams for this same reason (i.e. only 32 NFL teams exist in the world).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
Inspiration for this website came from [Wealth, Shown To Scale](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/) by [Matt Korostoff](https://github.com/MKorostoff).

# Wealth Inequality Simulator/ Visualization

Utilized a real-time financial data API to visualize the wealth gap between the ultra-rich and the average citizen.
This application was designed to be informative and incite conversation on economic and financial inequality.

Inspiration for this website came from [Wealth, Shown To Scale](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/) by [Matt Korostoff](https://github.com/MKorostoff).

The application was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS within a React framework. [Mantine](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine) was chosen as the component library due to the wide variety of styles and themes, along with the great support and documentation. Toast-notifications to handle unsuitable user-input were generated by [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
